## ðŸ¤” What is Angel up to?

- Learning how the linux kernel works handles network connections.

## ðŸ“š Books I like

- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment, 3rd Edition 3rd Edition by W. Stevens (Author), Stephen Rago
  - Great for learning a LOT about UNIX its programming interface in C. Doing the exercises in this book really enhanced my C programming skills.
 
- Inside the Machine by Jon Stokes
  - Very easy to understand computer architecture book. Still in progress...
